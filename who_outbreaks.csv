Deaths have occurred in all age groups, but adolescents and young adults, particularly males, appeared to be disproportionately affected in the initial cluster reported. Disease progression appeared to be fast, with a median time from onset of symptoms to death of one day. Given the rapid decline in the incidence of reported deaths, their geographic clustering, the age profile of deaths and the rapid disease progression in the initial cluster, working hypotheses include chemical poisoning or a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster, on a background of malaria and other infectious illnesses endemic in the region. The definitive cause of illness remains undetermined, with initial samples testing negative for Ebola and Marburg viruses. Field investigations and additional laboratory testing are ongoing including but not limited to the cerebrospinal fluid testing and the toxicological analysis of environmental samples, including water and other samples to explore chemical causes. Local authorities began surveillance with a broad case definition including any individual with fever and at least one other symptom, to better understand disease patterns. A total of 1318 patients had symptoms meeting the working suspected case definition as of 25 February 2025. Approximately 50% of malaria tests performed on these cases tested positive for malaria, the cases identified through this enhanced surveillance therefore likely reflect the various febrile illnesses in the area.

These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other common respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae. Many countries conduct routine surveillance for acute respiratory infections and common respiratory pathogens. Currently, in some countries in the temperate Northern hemisphere, influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) rates have increased in recent weeks and are above baseline levels, following usual seasonal trends. Seasonal influenza activity is elevated in many countries in the Northern hemisphere. Where surveillance data is available, trends in RSV detections currently vary by region with decreases reported in most regions except in North America.Recently, there has been interest in hMPV cases in China including suggestions of hospitals being overwhelmed. hMPV is a common respiratory virus found to circulate in many countries in winter through to spring, although not all countries routinely test and publish data on trends in hMPV . While some cases can be hospitalized with bronchitis or pneumonia, most people infected with hMPV have mild upper respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold and recover after a few days.Based on data published by China, covering the period up to 29 December 2024, acute respiratory infections have increased during recent weeks and detections of seasonal influenza, rhinovirus, RSV, and hMPV, particularly in northern provinces of China have also increased. The observed increase in respiratory pathogen detections is within the range expected for this time of year during the Northern hemisphere winter. In China, influenza is the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen currently affecting people with acute respiratory infections. WHO is in contact with Chinese health officials and has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns. Chinese authorities report that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses triggered.WHO continues to monitor respiratory illnesses at global, regional and country levels through collaborative surveillance systems, and provides updates as needed.","https://www.who.int/2025-DON550","WHO API","","","",""

On 29 November, an alert was raised by local health zone authorities of Panzi health zone in Kwango province after an increase in deaths, particularly among children under five years of age, following febrile illness. Enhanced epidemiological surveillance was rapidly implemented, which in the absence of a clear diagnosis was based on the detection of syndromic cases of febrile illnesses with cough, body weakness, with one of a number of other symptoms compatible with acute respiratory and febrile illnesses. This resulted in a rapid increase in the number of cases meeting the definition, with a total of 891 cases reported as of 16 December. However, the weekly number of reported deaths (48 deaths reported over the period) has remained relatively stable. As of 16 December, laboratory results from a total of 430 samples indicated positive results for malaria, common respiratory viruses (Influenza A (H1N1, pdm09), rhinoviruses, SARS-COV-2, Human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, and Human Adenovirus).While further laboratory tests are ongoing, together these findings suggest that a combination of common and seasonal viral respiratory infections and falciparum malaria, compounded by acute malnutrition led to an increase in severe infections and deaths, disproportionally affecting children under five years of age. Multidisciplinary rapid response teams have been deployed to investigate the event and strengthen the response. Efforts are ongoing to address the health needs in Panzi health zone.

K. pneumoniae strains that can cause severe infections in healthy individuals and have been identified with increasing frequency in recent years are considered hypervirulent compared to classical strains because of their ability to infect both healthy and immunocompromised individuals and because of their increased tendency to produce invasive infections.The presence of hvKp ST23 was reported in at least one country in all six WHO Regions. The emergence of these isolates with resistance to last-line antibiotics like carbapenems necessitates the administration of alternative antimicrobial treatment, which may not be available in many contexts.

While a substantial increase in dengue cases has been reported globally in the last five years, this increase has been particularly pronounced in the Region of the Americas, where the number of cases has already exceeded seven million by the end of April 2024, surpassing the annual high of 4.6 million cases in 2023. Currently, 90 countries have known active dengue transmission in 2024, not all of which have been captured in formal reporting. In addition, many endemic countries do not have strong detection and reporting mechanisms, so the true burden of dengue globally is underestimated. In order to control transmission more effectively, real-time robust dengue surveillance is needed to address concerns about potential undetected cases, co-circulation and misdiagnosis as other arboviruses, and unrecorded travel movements. These factors could contribute to unrecognized disease spread and establish a potential risk for local transmission in non-endemic countries. Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. To strengthen global surveillance, and monitor temporal trends and disease incidence, WHO has established a global dengue surveillance system with monthly reporting across all WHO regions with a new dashboard now live (https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/). The overall capacity for countries to respond to multiple, concurrent outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early disease detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control staff and community awareness. Emergency response mechanisms have been established, and WHO supports high-risk countries across affected regions.Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as High and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.","https://www.who.int/2024-DON518","WHO API","","","",""

Ouaddai province has been heavily affected by an influx of refugees and returnees fleeing the Sudan conflict since April 2023, with a majority being women and children.From 2 January to 28 April 2024, a total of 2092 suspected hepatitis E cases, including seven deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) 0.3%), were reported from two health districts of the Ouaddai province, namely, Adré and Hadjer-Hadid. Among the 2092 suspected cases, 103 (4.9%) were from the host community and 1989 (95%) were reported from seven refugee camps and transit sites. Both rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to confirm the diagnosis on collected samples. The most affected age groups are 6 -17 years (1113 cases) and 18-59 years (500 cases), representing 53.2% and 23.9% of the suspected cases respectively. A total of 27 pregnant women (1.3%) have been reported among the suspected cases. Hepatitis E is often occurring in humanitarian settings such as in areas affected by conflict and in displacement sites. Limited access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene increases the risk of hepatitis E virus outbreaks. The Public Health Emergency Operations Centre has been activated by the national health authorities. WHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in Adré to support setting up the response and response activities are ongoing with partners support. Prevention is the most effective approach against hepatitis E. Provision of safe drinking water, good hygiene practices, quality standards for public water supplies and provision of safely managed sanitation services can significantly decrease the risk of spread.WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.","https://www.who.int/2024-DON517","WHO API","","","",""

Eleven of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are identified as endemic for mpox, but in more recent years the total number of mpox cases and the number of provinces reporting mpox has been expanding, to 22 provinces as of November 2023. There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously known as the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West African clade; clade II further has two subclades: clade IIa and clade IIb. Before 2018, very few cases were reported outside of the African continent: eight international travellers returning from endemic countries and one outbreak related to imported animals. Since 2022, an epidemic of clade IIb MPXV has been ongoing globally, affecting many countries outside the African continent that had never reported mpox previously. The spread of this epidemic was mainly driven by transmission via sexual contact among men who have sex with men. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has not reported cases of mpox linked to clade IIb MPXV during the global outbreak to date; only MPXV clade I has been detected in the country. Before April 2023, no formally documented cases of sexual transmission of clade I MPXV were registered globally. The first known cases were reported when a man, resident in Belgium and with connections to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, tested positive for clade I in Kenge, Kwango province, during a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thereafter, sexual contacts of this case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo also tested positive for clade I MPXV, with closely related viral sequences. This is the first time that reported clade I MPXV infection is linked to sexual transmission within a cluster. Another outbreak in the country is also being reported with multiple cases of mpox among sex workers. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human-to-human transmission of mpox through close contact has been reported since the 1970s, mostly in small household or community outbreaks, presumed to be primarily due to zoonotic transmission. Due to a lack of timely access to diagnostics, difficulties with linking cases to any contact with infectious animals, and incomplete epidemiological and contact tracing investigations over the years, the dynamics of MPXV clade I transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not well understood. These new features of sexual and unknown modes of transmission now raise additional concerns over the continuing rapid expansion of the outbreak in the country. In the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022, clade IIb MPXV transmission between humans continues in most WHO regions. In addition, clade I MPXV community outbreaks occur regularly in three countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and sporadically in others (e.g., Sudan, South Sudan). In some of these geographic areas in East, West and Central Africa, transmission from animals to humans is also presumed to occur. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown; while various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are known to be susceptible, they have rarely been linked to outbreaks.","https://www.who.int/2023-DON493","WHO API","","","",""

This is the first confirmed human case reported after more than two decades, since the last reported human cases in Argentina occurred in 1982/1983 and 1996. WEE is a rare mosquito-borne viral disease that affects equines and humans. Most human cases are associated with epidemics in birds or horses. The virus has the potential to spread to other areas through the migration of infected birds or the movement of people and animals carrying the virus. Given that birds act as a reservoir, they can act as amplifying hosts for viral dissemination to other countries. At-risk groups include people who live, work, or participate in outdoor activities in endemic areas or where there are declared active disease outbreaks in animals.","https://www.who.int/2023-DON499","WHO API","","","",""

The first human cases were reported from the Dengeza Health Post in the Sinazongwe District of the Southern Province on 5 May 2023. Around the same time period, domestic (cattle and goats) and wild animals (hippopotami) were reportedly dying from an unknown cause in the surrounding areas. In June 2023, human and animal cases were reported in the Kanchindu and Siameja veterinary camps of Sinazongwe District. Twenty-six human cases developed sores on their face, arms, and fingers after consuming meat from three wild hippopotamus carcasses. The first human case was reported on 16 June 2023 and laboratory confirmed by culture at the Lusaka Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI). As of 20 November 2023, 684 suspected human cases, including four deaths, a Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)of 0.6%, were reported from 44 out of 116 districts in nine of Zambia’s 10 provinces. Sinazongwe district is the epicenter, accounting for 287 cases (42% of total 684 cases) and two deaths (50% of total the four deaths). The most affected provinces are the Southern (370 cases; 54 %), Western (88; 13%), Lusaka (82; 12%), Eastern (66; 10%) and Muchinga (47; 7 %) Provinces. The majority of symptomatic cases were epidemiologically linked to confirmed cases and not tested. This unprecedented outbreak marks the first major occurrence spanning nine out of 10 country provinces. The latest large-scale outbreak reported in Zambia occurred in 2011 with a total of 511 suspected cases.Response activities have been taken from both human and animal sides, such as active surveillance, case management, laboratory diagnosis, health promotion, and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), meat inspection and livestock vaccination.Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by a bacteria called Bacillus anthracis that typically affects ruminants (such as cows, sheep, and goats). The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins which are responsible for the symptoms, causing a high lethality rate in the pulmonary form. Humans can develop the disease from infected animals or through contaminated animal products. Hospitalization is required for all human cases identified. Vaccines are available for livestock and humans in limited supply.The risk of the event spreading within Zambia is assessed to be high due to the unrestricted animal movement and carcasses within and between provinces. The risk at the regional level is also considered high due to the frequent movement of both animals and people between Zambia and its neighbouring countries (such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe).","https://www.who.int/2023-DON497","WHO API","","","",""

This is the first swine influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in the United Kingdom. Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been sporadically detected in the past in countries in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. When a human is infected with a swine-origin influenza virus, the virus is referred to as a variant (or “v”) virus. Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Current evidence suggests that these swine-origin influenza viruses have limited ability for sustained transmission among humans. This case was identified as part of routine surveillance of respiratory illnesses. The source of infection for this case is under investigation and contact tracing is in process. To date, no other confirmed cases associated with this event have been reported. WHO is in communication with national authorities to monitor the situation closely. Ongoing investigations are in place to identify the source of the infection and to characterize the risks of this influenza variant virus. WHO assesses the risk of spread of swine-origin influenza viruses through humans and/or community-level spread among humans as low. However, because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.","https://www.who.int/2023-DON496","WHO API","","","",""

While most cases are not associated with travel from endemic areas, Member States are also reporting small numbers of cases in travelers from Nigeria, as has been observed before.The sudden and unexpected appearance of monkeypox simultaneously in several non-endemic countries suggests that there might have been undetected transmission for some unknown duration of time followed by recent amplifier events.WHO assesses the risk at the global level as moderate considering this is the first time that many monkeypox cases and clusters are reported concurrently in non-endemic and endemic countries in widely disparate WHO geographical areas.WHO continues to receive updates on the situation in endemic countries.","https://www.who.int/2022-DON390","WHO API","","","",""
